# Control Structures in Python

## Overview

Master conditional statements, loops, and decision-making in Python. Learn how to use if-elif-else statements, while and for loops, loop control statements (break, continue), and apply these concepts to solve practical problems involving iterations and conditions.

**Topics:** If-Elif-Else statements | For loops | While loops | Break & Continue | Nested structures | Loop patterns

**Learn to:** Write conditional logic | Use different loop types | Control loop flow | Create nested structures | Solve iteration problems

## 1. If-Elif-Else Statements

**Concept:** Conditional statements allow you to execute different code blocks based on different conditions. If-elif-else statements provide multiple condition branches.

```python
# code1


# code2


# code3


# code4


# code5


# code6


# code7


# code8

```

## 2. For Loops

**Concept:** For loops are used to iterate over sequences (like lists, strings, ranges). They execute a block of code a specific number of times.

```python
# code1


# code2


# code3


# code4


# code5


# code6


# code7


# code8

```

## 3. While Loops

**Concept:** While loops repeat as long as a condition is true. They are useful when you don't know how many times you need to iterate.

```python
# code1


# code2


# code3


# code4


# code5


# code6


# code7


# code8

```

## 4. Break and Continue

**Concept:** Break terminates a loop, while continue skips the current iteration. These statements give you fine control over loop execution.

```python
# code1


# code2


# code3


# code4


# code5


# code6


# code7


# code8

```

## 5. Nested Loops

**Concept:** Nested loops are loops inside loops. They are useful for working with multidimensional data structures or creating patterns.

```python
# code1


# code2


# code3


# code4


# code5


# code6


# code7


# code8

```

## 6. Loop Patterns

**Concept:** Common loop patterns include summing, counting, searching, and filtering. Understanding these patterns helps solve many problems efficiently.

```python
# code1


# code2


# code3


# code4


# code5


# code6


# code7


# code8

```

## 7. Range Function

**Concept:** The range() function generates a sequence of numbers. It's commonly used with for loops to iterate a specific number of times.

```python
# code1


# code2


# code3


# code4


# code5


# code6


# code7


# code8

```

## 8. Loop Control Applications

**Concept:** Practical applications of loop control include validating input, searching for values, transforming data, and solving mathematical problems.

```python
# code1


# code2


# code3


# code4


# code5


# code6


# code7


# code8

```
